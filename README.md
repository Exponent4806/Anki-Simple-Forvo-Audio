# Anki Simple Forvo Audio
Main goal of this addon is to make forvo audio easy (and **free** ) to use.

AwesomeTTS supports forvo, but only if you pay for an API key or subscribe to their patreon. <br> I wrote this to avoid monthly payments.

The addon has 2 functionalities:

## Select and fetch
Gif should make it straightforward. Select your word, rightclick on * Add Forvo Audio*. <br>
This brings you to a pop up where you can quickly search for your word, choose your language, and the destination field.

You can also also preview the audios before you choose one.

## Auto Fetch (NOT RECOMMENDED (yet))
My deformed son. <br>
It takes in a deck and, depending on the fields you select, downloads audios from either forvo or my own CDN that uses forvo when needed.<br>


It can save you some time and effort on large decks, **BUT** <br>
**Warning**: **Can get you ip banned if you overuse it!**

Forvo is cracking down on IP's that download too many audios from her site in bulks. I set a limit of 100 audios. 
You can edit this limit in the config, if you feel lucky. 

Use this feature at your own risk, I might find a safer way get the audios in bulks later on that's still free.
